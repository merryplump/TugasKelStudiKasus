<h1>Cooking with Daniel from Nada Surf</h1>

<p>I had the pleasure of spending a crisp, Spring day in Portsmouth, NH cooking and chatting with Daniel<br> Lorca of the band Nada Surf as he prepared a gourmet, sit-down dinner for 28 pals.</p>

<p>When I first invited Nada Surf to be on the show, I was told that Daniel Lorca was the guy I wanted to<br> talk to. Then Daniel emailed his response: "i'm way into it, but i don't want to talk about it, i wanna do<br> it." After years of only having access to touring bands between their sound check and set, I've been<br> doing a lot of <em>talking</em> about cooking with rockstars. To actually cook with a band was a dream come<br> true.</p>

<h2>Six-hour Salad</h2>

<p><img src="salads.jpg" alt="Smoked tomato salads on plates"></p>

<p>Daniel prepared a salad of arugula, smoked tomatoes,<br> tomato jam, and grilled avocado (it's as good as it sounds!). I<br> jokingly called it "6-hour Salad" because that's how long he<br> worked on it. The fresh tomatoes were slowly smoked over<br> woodchips in the grill, and when they were softened, Daniel<br> separated out the seeds which he reduced into a smoky jam.<br> The tomatoes were cut into strips to put on the salads. As<br> the day meandered, the avocados finally went on the grill<br> after dark. I was on flashlight duty while Daniel checked for<br> the perfect grill marks.</p>

<p>I wrote up a streamlined adaptation of his recipe that<br> requires <em>much</em> less time and serves 6 people instead of <em>five</em>times that amount.</p>


<h2>The Main Course</h2>

<p>In addition to the smoky grilled salad, Daniel served tarragon cornish hens with a cognac cream sauce<br> loaded with chanterelles and grapes, and wild rice with grilled ramps (wild garlicky leeks). Dinner was<br> served close to midnight, but it was a party so nobody cared.</p>

<p>We left that night (technically, early the next morning) with full bellies, new cooking tips, and nearly 5<br> hours of footage. I'm considering renaming the show "Cooking with Nada Surf". </p>
